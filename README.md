# Library

This project is a sketch of a library webpage. I have made it possible to add books, remove books from the library, and change their read status. I faced some challenges while working on it, but I was still able to finish it in the end, thanks to TOP's Discord community. Throughout this project, I have strengthened my understanding of DOM elements, prototypes, and gained hands-on practice with them.
